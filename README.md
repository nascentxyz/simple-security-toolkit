# Simple Security Toolkit
This repo is a collection of practical security-focused tips and resources for smart contract development, assembled by the [Nascent](https://www.nascent.xyz/) team to share with our portfolio companies and others in the ecosystem who might find it useful. It is not intended to be comprehensive; it skews towards practical and opinionated recommendations that we find to be appropriate particularly for teams developing and managing early versions of a protocol.

### Contents

1. **[Development Process](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/development-process.md)**

One of the most crucial factors in having a secure codebase is a solid development process: "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." This document gives an example development process that we, at Nascent, have found works well. It walks through the steps from initial design and feature requests -> specification -> evaluation -> implementation -> testing -> deployment -> monitoring.

2. **[Audit Readiness Checklist](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/audit-readiness-checklist.md)**

Audits are expensive, time consuming, and need to be scheduled months in advance. Completing this checklist helps ensure a codebase is ready for outside review and helps catch as much low-hanging fruit as possible. This will allow the auditors to focus their time and attention on identifying deeper and more critical vulnerabilities.

3. **[Pre-Launch Security Checklist](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/pre-launch-security-checklist.md)**

Before deploying your code to mainnet, complete this checklist to make sure you have taken the necessary steps to enable reporting and responding to potential bugs or security incidents.

4. **[Incident Response Plan Template](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/incident-response-plan-template.md)**

No project ever expects to have a security incident. Having a plan documented in advance can help your team respond swiftly and calmly in the heat of the moment when adrenaline is running high.
